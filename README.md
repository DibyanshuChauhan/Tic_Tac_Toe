## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
3. Two players take turns marking a square with `X` or `O`.
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
5. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
